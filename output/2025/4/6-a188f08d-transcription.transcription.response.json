  "text": "One of the most interesting things about the term AI was how people viewed it. You know, how unknowing it is. I remember talking to somebody at Google about a year before the news broke about JGPT. And what I'll tell you is that it was actually somewhat disturbed by its capabilities. Because this guy is one of the experts. He would know his name if I said it. He was like, listen, this is really freaking people out. We did not expect this. So, I think it's an interesting area. I think we suffer from something right now. I think all companies suffer from. Nobody wants to admit just how new it is. And just how unknown the future potential is. I think this journey has just started. I don't really, I'm really, I'm actually really interested in what's coming next. So much so, I've got to tell you, I've spent the majority of my free time doing this. I feel like it's 1995 again. And we're all looking for a little bit more. And there's fascinating things you can do with it. There's genetic applications to genetics and vaccines. You know, making new fusion reactors with the generative AI function. I'm actually much more focused on the more immediate aspects, which is, how can we use it to support customers? How can we use it? I use it in my personal life now. Just about everything. I don't send an email without asking it to read me a couple different drafts. My son's ADHD is being cracked. It's not a therapist. I have a friend who said, it's a therapist. You're going to need to be careful. You're going to need, that's going to really, it isn't going to be like a therapy. But I'm using it to track patterns I might not be good at seeing. One limitation in IT that we always have is relationships. Like having an accurate picture of how you're getting along with people. I use it personally to support that. I have a devil's advocate agent that runs, reads my email. Before I read it, it lets me know here are the emails that I'm going to react to. These are the emails I shouldn't respond to. For at least a day or two. And I got to tell you, the level of complexity that I had to do to get that done. That's not just running like 4-0-mini. That's running 4-0-mini 10 times to do four different classification runs. And then sync it all together, run it through O1. It's expensive, but I tell you, it has really helped. This is what I do for fun in my life. I think on top of that, what I really enjoy about working at Walmart is being able to see the teacher."
