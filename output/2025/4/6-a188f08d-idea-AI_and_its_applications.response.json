About a year before the public knew about significant advancements like those in JGPT, I had a conversation with a well-known expert at Google who expressed surprise and some concern at AI's capabilities. There's a notable hesitance within companies to fully admit how novel AI is and the uncertainty of its future potential. I genuinely feel as if we're in a technological renaissance, similar to 1995's tech boom, where every development seems promising and groundbreaking.\n\nAI applications are vast, ranging from genetic enhancements and vaccine development to improving technology like fusion reactors. However, my current fascination is with AI's more immediate applications, such as enhancing customer interactions and improving personal life. I integrate AI into almost every aspect of my daily routine, from drafting emails to monitoring my son's ADHD. A friend humorously likened AI to a therapist, though I'm cautious and use it to identify patterns I might miss otherwise.\n\nIn the IT field, understanding relationships and communication dynamics can be challenging, so I employ a personal AI agent to preview my emails. This agent highlights potentially reactionary emails and suggests a delay in response, which helps manage my reactions and interactions better. The setup for this system is complex, involving multiple classification runs and synchronizations, yet the insights it provides are invaluable despite the financial investment.\n\n## Related People or Projects\n\n- Google AI Experts\n- JGPT\n- Walmart (in relation to viewing teaching opportunities)\n\n## Tasks\n\n- Research further into AI's role in genetics and vaccines.\n- Explore advancements in fusion reactor technology utilizing AI.\n- Investigate additional ways AI can enhance personal life and interpersonal relationships.\n```\n",
