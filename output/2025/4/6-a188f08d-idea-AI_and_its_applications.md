## Idea: AI and its Applications

- AI is perceived as an unknown and somewhat mystical term, generating varied perspectives.
- Conversations with experts, like those at Google, reveal both excitement and apprehension regarding AI's capabilities.
- There's a widespread reluctance among companies to acknowledge the novelty and untapped potential of AI.
- I'm intensely interested in exploring where AI is headed, reminiscent of the transformative period of 1995.
- AI holds significant potential in various fields, including genetics, vaccines, and technological advancements like fusion reactors.
- My focus is on the immediate applications of AI, particularly in customer support and personal life enhancements.
- AI assists me with tasks such as drafting emails, tracking my son's ADHD patterns, and understanding interpersonal relationships.
- I've developed a personal AI system to analyze my emails, identifying which ones might provoke a reaction and advising on response timing.
- Setting up this system required complex configurations but has been beneficial despite the cost.
- This exploration of AI is not just workâ€”it's also a personal passion.

## Idea Details

The concept of AI is intriguing in its vagueness, especially in how it's perceived by laypeople and experts alike. About a year before the public knew about significant advancements like those in JGPT, I had a conversation with a well-known expert at Google who expressed surprise and some concern at AI's capabilities. There's a notable hesitance within companies to fully admit how novel AI is and the uncertainty of its future potential. I genuinely feel as if we're in a technological renaissance, similar to 1995's tech boom, where every development seems promising and groundbreaking.

AI applications are vast, ranging from genetic enhancements and vaccine development to improving technology like fusion reactors. However, my current fascination is with AI's more immediate applications, such as enhancing customer interactions and improving personal life. I integrate AI into almost every aspect of my daily routine, from drafting emails to monitoring my son's ADHD. A friend humorously likened AI to a therapist, though I'm cautious and use it to identify patterns I might miss otherwise.

In the IT field, understanding relationships and communication dynamics can be challenging, so I employ a personal AI agent to preview my emails. This agent highlights potentially reactionary emails and suggests a delay in response, which helps manage my reactions and interactions better. The setup for this system is complex, involving multiple classification runs and synchronizations, yet the insights it provides are invaluable despite the financial investment.
