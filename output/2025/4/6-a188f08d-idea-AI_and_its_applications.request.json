Task #1 - You are capturing and organizing notes from the transcript of an audio recording you made of your ideas and thoughts.

Task #2 - Analyze the transcript and determine if your idea is a continuation of a previous note related to your idea, or if this is a new idea of yours.

Task #3 - If the idea is about a project, a person, a place, or a thing, please identify what entity your idea is related to in another field.

Task #4 - When reading the transcript look for directions to do research into this idea and identify information that might need to be gathered to further develop the idea.

Remember that this is your idea and you are capturing notes on your idea.  When you write a note on an idea that is yours, please use the word "I" to refer to yourself.

## Instructions for Creating an Idea Note

An **Idea** note clearly captures and preserves one of your ideas, thoughts, or suggestions. 

An idea note does not require structured sections or bulleted lists, but if could be helpful to use them if the idea is detailed and lengthy.

- If your idea is brief, capture it as concise bullet points.
- If your idea is detailed or lengthy, capture details of your idea clearly in paragraphs, ensuring no critical information is omitted.

### Example Idea Notes:

```markdown
## Idea: We Need More Ice Cream

- The people have spoken, and we need more ice cream.
- There is a revolution afoot, we should be wary of the consequences.

## Idea Details

I shared an idea about ice cream.  Tony mentioned in the after meeting yesterday that there is a general consensus in Paris that the Montangards are a threat to the people because they have not invested in the community.  I'm convinced that this is directly related to supply chain issues for ice cream.

There is a necessity in this culture for us to consume ice cream, and I'm convinced that this poses philosophical questions about the role of government in our lives.

## Related People or Projects

- Montangards
- Ice Cream
- Supply Chain

## Tasks

- Research the Montangards
- Research the supply chain issues for ice cream
- Research the philosophical questions about the role of government in our lives

You know, how unknowing it is. I remember talking to somebody at Google about a year before the news broke about JGPT. And what I'll tell you is that it was actually somewhat disturbed by its capabilities. Because this guy is one of the experts. He would know his name if I said it. He was like, listen, this is really freaking people out. We did not expect this. So, I think it's an interesting area. I think we suffer from something right now. I think all companies suffer from. Nobody wants to admit just how new it is. And just how unknown the future potential is. I think this journey has just started. I don't really, I'm really, I'm actually really interested in what's coming next. So much so, I've got to tell you, I've spent the majority of my free time doing this. I feel like it's 1995 again. And we're all looking for a little bit more. And there's fascinating things you can do with it. There's genetic applications to genetics and vaccines. You know, making new fusion reactors with the generative AI function. I'm actually much more focused on the more immediate aspects, which is, how can we use it to support customers? How can we use it? I use it in my personal life now. Just about everything. I don't send an email without asking it to read me a couple different drafts. My son's ADHD is being cracked. It's not a therapist. I have a friend who said, it's a therapist. You're going to need to be careful. You're going to need, that's going to really, it isn't going to be like a therapy. But I'm using it to track patterns I might not be good at seeing. One limitation in IT that we always have is relationships. Like having an accurate picture of how you're getting along with people. I use it personally to support that. I have a devil's advocate agent that runs, reads my email. Before I read it, it lets me know here are the emails that I'm going to react to. These are the emails I shouldn't respond to. For at least a day or two. And I got to tell you, the level of complexity that I had to do to get that done. That's not just running like 4-0-mini. That's running 4-0-mini 10 times to do four different classification runs. And then sync it all together, run it through O1. It's expensive, but I tell you, it has really helped. This is what I do for fun in my life. I think on top of that, what I really enjoy about working at Walmart is being able to see the teacher.","recordingTime":"2025-04-06T23:01:33.000Z"}
